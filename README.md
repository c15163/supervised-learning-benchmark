#📘 Supervised Learning Benchmark: Five Classifiers on Two Datasets

This project evaluates five classical supervised learning algorithms across two datasets (binary & multiclass) to compare model accuracy, training time, and behavior with respect to hyperparameter selection and learning curves.

The classifiers implemented:

Decision Tree

Neural Network (MLPClassifier)

Support Vector Machine

AdaBoost

K-Nearest Neighbors

The full analysis is documented in the final report and reproduced here with runnable Python code.
